# Cats and dogs in #HongKong protest art: a thread

*Sep 23, 2019*

Away from superheroes, we've seen cats and dogs pop up in protest art, showing a different aspect of how HKers view themselves. PS this should be light and fun? 1/7

For @HongKongHermit, still in Twitter jail, who likes cats and HK

Early Aug, HKPF started firing teargas with wild abandon around resi. areas - our pets were being affected by the gas. It's one thing for masked protesters to eat TG, another for our fur babies to suffer. These cute posters were for a rally against police actions in mid Aug. 2/7

Protect our furbabies, stop police violence. At the very bottom is an advertisement for the Aug 18 rally against police actions.](images/thread2/t2-p1.jpg)

As these show, our cats stay indoors, don't give a fig about politics and still got whacked by indiscriminate policing. If there're HKers who still believed they can look away, these kitties are saying - no, there is no escape from politics, it'll impact you sooner or later 3/7

A withered bauhinia logo is in the top right, with the protest slogan "Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our Times" underneath. A caption in Chinese underneath the image of the cat reads: "(Even if) you don't seek out politics, politics will seek out you."](images/thread2/t2-p5.jpg)

The captions read: "Stop harming Hong Kong citizens! Stop harming our underlings! Hong Kongers, add oil!"](images/thread2/t2-p8.jpg)

The HKers as cats metaphor works nicely because the police are so hated they are referred to as dogs. They're presented as sometimes yapping and annoying, sometimes vicious and rabid. What's always implicit is that they have a master, and it's not the HK people. 4/7

Fighting back isâ€¦the feline frontline? ðŸ˜¸ (Bet those of you who followed me hoping to see more badass art of 'braves' in teargas weren't expecting cosplaying cats!) HKers - as cats! - don hardhats and goggles to fight tyranny and bring about the revolution, as cats do. 5/7

Cats are tough but they're also just just vulnerable furballs. The 'peaceful' cats shown here look happier playing with laser pens than our geared up cats. Our kittens cry singing the new anthem. And in that last one, the tabby reminds HKers we cannot afford to lose anyone. 6/7

The 'best' art out of HK will likely paint pictures of fire and glory, 'cos those look good. But cats and dogs can be just as insightful abt what and who we fight for beyond '5 demands' - they say HK's fight is as much for the suppressed and voiceless as it is for ourselves. 7/7

## Update, Nov 21, 2019

UPDATE: Heavy use of teargas means weâ€™ve been seeing unusually high number of dead critters, other than cats & dogs. Recent art from TG protests against HKPF hurting these innocent, defenceless creatures. We may be fearless on the streets, but HKers are just big softies inside ðŸ˜­
